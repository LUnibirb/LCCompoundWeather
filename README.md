# LCCompoundWeather

This is a beginner Lethal Company mod that allows for new types of weather conditions to be found on the different Moons.
They are planned to be mixes between multiple different already existing weather conditions.

Some examples that plan to be added;
Rainy + Foggy = Misty
Eclipsed + Foggy = Dark
Stormy + Flooded = Surged
